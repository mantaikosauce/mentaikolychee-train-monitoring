# Nebula Wayside — the app

The compulsory deliverable (spec §4.1 item 3): one app, every subsystem, usable by
a non-technical person, and the tool that generates `predictions.zip`.

## Run it

From the project root, in the project venv (`python -m venv .venv` then
`.venv/Scripts/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`):

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python -m streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Or from the command line, the same pipeline without the UI:

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python -m scripts.build_predictions
```

Then open http://localhost:8501.

## Architecture

        │
        └──► core/submission.py    official schemas, validation, zip builder
                  └──► predictions/predictions.zip
```

- **The app contains no modelling code.** It calls `analyze()` for display and
  `predict()` for submission — both go through the same inference path inside
  each package, so the screen and the CSV cannot disagree.
- **Adding a subsystem** is one `SubsystemSpec` entry in `core/registry.py` plus a
  package exposing `predict()` and `analyze()`. No page code changes for the
  overview, submission or method pages.
- **Colour and type come from the design system's `tokens.json`**, resolved at
  startup. Change a token there and the app follows.
- **Nothing downloads unless it passes `core/submission.py`**, which enforces the
  official column names, order, label spelling, timestamp format, ID set and
  extension rules. A malformed file is refused with the reason shown.

## Data sources and datasets

A fresh session starts on **Live only** (today's events plus the live feeds). Every
file analysed becomes a named dataset in the fleet log ("Upload 19 Sep 02:10");
the **Data source** bar on the Dashboard and Fleet view switches between live only,
one dataset, or everything, and **Manage datasets** loads the competition test run
or removes a dataset. Nothing is loaded behind the user's back. Re-analysing the
same file adds no duplicate events.

## Schematics

Drawn only where the data supports them: the ACV train (cars coloured by their own
ranking), the Rail train (each axle box by its own vibration RMS, the named rail
dashed) and the selected Door cycle (leaf, motor, measured current). SHM has no
location data, so it shows damage per file and a remaining-life forecast instead.

## Pages

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | hero with live weather and the one-line fleet verdict, quick-drop uploader that routes any competition-format file to its subsystem, work queue (acknowledge / close), dark, map-first: KPI cards, status-overview bar, trend, the network map with line paths, zones, live NEA weather (rain gauges, temperatures), events table with status pills and a Fault/Watch filter; tabs for subsystems, trends, zones and the training data. Opens on the cached run of the competition test data |
| Door | segment a stream, verdict card, cycle timeline, sustained-current scatter, per-cycle inspector, download |
| Structural health | damage per file against D = 1, per-file cycle and damage-share profiles, stress envelope, download |
| Fleet view | the fleet event log filtered by time range (today to a year, or custom dates), line, subsystem and state: event clusters on the map, train health index, timeline, event table and CSV; live NEA weather, DataMall crowd density and service alerts (user's own AccountKey), SGMRT channel |
| Rail | classify 1-second recordings, per-side axle-box energy grid, wavelength-domain spectrum from the measured speed, class probabilities, download |
| Air conditioning | rank all eight cars by cabin-temperature excess over the other cars during cooling, CarRank bars, excess timeline, download |
| Parameter monitor | label-free screen for a new dataset: peer comparison across units (the ACV method) or robust drift for one series; recipe for promoting it to a subsystem |
| Validation | per-fold scores with mean, sd, naive baseline and in-sample line for every subsystem; the Rail pre-registered experiment table |
| Submission | runs every live model over the test inputs, validates, builds and saves `predictions.zip` (all four subsystems) |
| Method | architecture diagram, validation table, principles |

## Demo video path (≤ 3 minutes)

1. Overview — the four tiles and what "cross-validated" means (15 s)
2. Door — Analyse → verdict → inspect a flagged cycle → download (60 s)
3. Structural health — Assess → worst file → "0.1% of cycles cause 99% of damage" (45 s)
4. Submission — build `predictions.zip` through the app (30 s)
5. Method — one sentence on leakage-safe validation (15 s)

## Notes

- `.streamlit/config.toml` holds the theme and a 400 MB upload limit. If the
  launcher runs from another directory, pass the same values as `--theme.*` flags.
- SHM on all 16 test files takes ~20 s (rainflow counting) and Rail on all 68
  takes ~3 min (17 MB each); both pages show a per-file progress bar.
- Rail and ACV models are ported unchanged from the teammate's
  `PS3/final_streamlit_app` build; `subsystems/<key>/artifacts/config.json` is
  the model card, `validation_source.json` the original report.
- The station map is bundled at `data/stations/`. Live feeds: NEA weather from
  data.gov.sg needs no key; LTA DataMall TrainServiceAlerts needs the user's own
  AccountKey (register at datamall.lta.gov.sg), typed into the Fleet page per
  session; the public SGMRT channel needs no key. All are time-limited and the
  pages render without them.
- `predictions/analysis_cache.pkl` (gitignored) is written by
  `scripts/build_predictions.py` and gives every page results on open. Delete it
  or press Run all to refresh.
